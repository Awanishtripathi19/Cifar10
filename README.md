# Cifar10

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used collection of 60,000 color images, divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. These images are small, 32x32 pixels, and are often used for benchmarking computer vision and machine learning algorithms. CIFAR-10 is a popular choice for tasks like image classification, object recognition, and deep learning model development. It's valuable for research and education due to its diversity of objects and real-world image challenges.
